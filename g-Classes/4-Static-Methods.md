## JavaScript Static Methods and Properties
- By definition, `static methods` are bound to a class, not the instances of that class.
- Static class methods are defined on the class itself.
- You cannot call a static method on an object, only on an object class.
- In ES6, you define static methods using the `static keyword`. 
- The following example defines a `static method` called `getName()` for the `Person` class:
```ts
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  static age = 10;
  static getName() {
    return "Hello"
  }
}
```
- To invoke the static method, you use the following syntax:
```ts
let name = Person.getName();
let age = Person.age;
console.log(name)  //  prints "Hello"
console.log(age)  //  prints 10
```
- If you attempt to call the static method from an instance of the class, youâ€™ll get an error.
- For example:
```ts
let person = new Person('Joy');
let name = person.getName();
```
- Error:
```ts
TypeError: person.getName is not a function
```
