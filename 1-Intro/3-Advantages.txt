// Some of the advantages of JavaScript are:
-Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
-Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don’t have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
-Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
-Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
