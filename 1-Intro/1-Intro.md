#### What is Javascript?

`JavaScript` is a lightweight, cross-platform, `single-threaded`, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript is `a weakly typed language` (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 

- JavaScript, created by `Brendan Eich` in `1995`, is one of the most widely used web development languages. 
- It was designed to build dynamic web pages at first. A script is a JS program that may be added to the HTML of any web page. When the page loads, these scripts execute automatically.
- A language that was originally designed to build dynamic web pages may now be run on the server and on almost any device that has the JavaScript Engine installed.
- After HTML and CSS, JavaScript is the third biggest web technology. 
- JavaScript is a scripting language that may be used to construct online and mobile apps, web servers, games, and more. 
- JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that is used to generate websites and applications. It was created with the intention of being used in a browser. 
-Even today, the server-side version of JavaScript known as Node.js may be used to create online and mobile apps, real-time applications, online streaming applications, and videogames. Javascript frameworks, often known as inbuilt libraries, may be used to construct desktop and mobile programs. 

#### JavaScript is Used for

- `Creating Interactive Websites`: JavaScript is used to make web pages dynamic and interactive. It means using JavaScript, we can change the web page content and styles dynamically.
- `Building Applications`: JavaScript is used to make web and mobile applications. To build web and mobile apps, we can use the most popular JavaScript frameworks like – ReactJS, React Native, Node.js etc.
- `Web Servers`: We can make robust server applications using JavaScript. To be precise we use JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and Express.js to build these servers.
- `Game Development`: JavaSCript can be used to design Browser games. In JavaScript, lots of game engines are available that provide frameworks for building games.

#### Advantages of JavaScript

- `Less server interaction` − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
- `Immediate feedback to the visitors` − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
- `Increased interactivity` − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
- `Richer interfaces` − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

#### Limitations of JavaScript

- `Security risks`: JavaScript can be used to fetch data using AJAX or by manipulating tags that load data such as <img>, <object>, <script>. These attacks are called cross-site script attacks. They inject JS that is not part of the site into the visitor’s browser thus fetching the details. 
- `Performance` : JavaScript does not provide the same level of performance as offered by many traditional languages as a complex program written in JavaScript would be comparatively slow. But as JavaScript is used to perform simple tasks in a browser, so performance is not considered a big restriction in its use.
- `Complexity` : To master a scripting language, programmers must have a thorough knowledge of all the programming concepts, core language objects, and client and server-side objects otherwise it would be difficult for them to write advanced scripts using JavaScript.
-  `Weak error handling and type checking facilities` : It is a weakly typed language as there is no need to specify the data type of the variable. So wrong type checking is not performed by compile.
- `Richer interfaces` : You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

#### JavaScript: Client side Vs Server side

`Client side` programming includes any coding or computation or effects or animation or any sort of interaction your website performs with the user via browser . But server side programming is that which performs all the task in the server only . So the user is unaware of that. Few years ago JavaScript compilers were available only on the client machine (browsers). So java script was called as a client side scripting language. On the client side JavaScript is run by v8 engine (Google chrome). But now in the `server side` also JavaScript is used. The v8 engine (with some modifications to provide the server functionality) is also used in the servers to run js codes. So, in both cases the language is the same, only the environment is different.

`Client Side JavaScript` is an extended version of JavaScript that enables the enhancement and manipulation of web pages and client browsers. In a browser environment , your code will have access to things provided only by the browser, like the document object for the current page, the window, functions like alert that pop up a message, etc. The main tasks of Client side JavaScript are validating input, animation, manipulating UI elements, applying styles, some calculations are done when you don't want the page to refresh so often. In web developing it's the browser, in the user's machine, that runs this code, and is mainly done in javascript . Also, this code must run in a variety of browsers.

`Server Side JavaScript` is an extended version of JavaScript that enables back-end access to databases, file systems, and servers. Server side javascript, is javascript code running over a server local resources , it's just like C# or Java, but the syntax is based on JavaScript. A good example of this is Node.JS , with Node.JS you write javascript to program on the server side, and that code can be seen as normal C#, C, or any other server side language code. Moreover, with server-side code , you can still send javascript to the client-side, but there is a great difference between both, because the client side code is restricted to the clients machine resources, in terms of computing power and permissions. For example client-side javascript can't access the clients hard disk , while with server side you can access your server hard disk without any problem. The primary advantage to server-side scripting is the ability to highly customize the response based on the user's requirements, access rights, or queries into data stores.

#### JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways

- Internal JavaScript
- External JavaScript
 
#### Internal JavaScript: We can add JS code directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the `<script>` & `</script>`. The <script> tag can either be placed inside the `<head>` or the `<body>` tag according to the requirement.

#### Example: It is the basic example of using JavaScript code inside of HTML code

```ts
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 
<head>
    <title>
        Basic Example to Describe JavaScript
    </title>
</head>
  
<body>
    <script>
        console.log("Hey, Whats up?");
    </script>
</body>
 
</html>
```
  
`External JavaScript` : We can create the file with a .js extension and paste the JS code inside of it. After creating the file, add this file in <script src=”file_name.js”> tag, and this <sctipt> can import inside <head> or <body> tag of the HTML file.

#### Example: It is the basic example of using JavaScript javascript code which is written in a different file. By importing that .js file in the head section.
  
```ts
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 
<head>
    <title>
        Basic Example to Describe JavaScript
    </title>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
</head>
 
<body>
</body>
 
</html>
```
