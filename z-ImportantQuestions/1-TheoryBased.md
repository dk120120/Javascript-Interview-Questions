### Q4. What are the variable naming conventions in JavaScript?
- You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keyword as variable name. For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid.
- JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or the underscore character. For example, 123name is an invalid variable name but _123name or name123 is a valid one.
- JavaScript variable names are case sensitive. For example, Test and test are two different variables.
