## Closure 

A closure can be defined as a JavaScript feature in which the inner function has access to the outer function variable. In JavaScript, every time a closure is created with the creation of a function.

The closure has three scope chains listed as follows:
- Access to its own scope.
- Access to the variables of the outer function.
- Access to the global variables.
