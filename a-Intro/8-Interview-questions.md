| JavaScript applications are meant to run inside a web browser.| Java applications are generally made for use in operating systems and virtual machines.|
| JavaScript does not need compilation before running the application code.|  Java code needs to be compiled. |

### Q2. What are the features of JavaScript?

### Q6. What is the ‘Strict’ mode in JavaScript and how can it be enabled?
Strict mode is a way to introduce better error-checking into your code.
When you use strict mode, you cannot use implicitly declared variables, or assign a value to a read-only property, or add a property to an object that is not extensible.
You can enable strict mode by adding “use strict” at the beginning of a file, a program, or a function.

### Q9. Difference between Client side JavaScript and Server side JavaScript?
- `Client-side JavaScript` comprises the basic language and predefined objects which are relevant to running JavaScript in a browser. The client-side JavaScript is embedded directly by in the HTML pages. The browser interprets this script at runtime.
- `Server-side JavaScript` also resembles client-side JavaScript. It has a relevant JavaScript which is to run in a server. The server-side JavaScript are deployed only after compilation.

### Q10. Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to a statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.Since javascript is a loosely(dynamically) typed language, variables in JS are not associated with any type. A variable can hold the value of any data type.
